# Hi, I’m Enoch — Hydrogeological Engineer & Groundwater Modeller

I work at the intersection of field investigations and numerical modelling to support contaminated site decisions, groundwater supply resilience, and defensible technical reporting.

## What I do
- **Contaminated site monitoring & plume interpretation:** integrate monitoring data, gradients, and pathway logic into clear conclusions.
- **Groundwater / subsurface modelling:** build MODFLOW-based workflows to test scenarios and quantify uncertainty.
- **GIS + technical reporting:** translate complex subsurface conditions into client- and regulator-ready deliverables (with strong QA/QC).

## Featured projects
- **Municipal Groundwater Supply Resilience (Groundwater Modelling)**  
  Reassessed supply capacity and long-term resilience under projected demand and infrastructure constraints.

- **Watershed-Scale Well Inventory + GIS Mapping**  
  Spatial analysis of boreholes/wells to understand vulnerability and support planning.

- **Potable Water Source Risk (Monte Carlo Health Risk Assessment)**  
  Probabilistic risk assessment comparing boreholes vs hand-dug wells using hazard index and cancer risk metrics.

- **Contaminant Plume Behaviour & Remediation Scenario Testing**  
  Model-supported understanding of plume behaviour and remediation decision trade-offs.

## Tools I use
MODFLOW • HydroGeoSphere • Leapfrog Works • FEFLOW • MT3DMS • ArcGIS/QGIS • ParaView • PyVista • Python
